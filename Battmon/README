About:
-------
Battmon is simple battery monitoring program written in python,
especially for tiling window managers like xmonad, dwm or awesome.


Features:
----------
- very light (for really basic functionality you need only python installed)
- works in background
- configurable
- no tray icon
- pop-up notifications
- options can be given through the command line (see battmon --help for details)


Prerequisites:
---------------
- python for basic functionality
  (>=3.2 and >=2.7 are supported, if you have another python version,
  install argparse from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse)

  * Optional
    - libnotify: for pop up notifications
    - sox/pulseaudio: for playing sounds
    - screen locker application: to lock user session before hibernating/suspending
    - pm-utils: for hibernate, suspend or shutdown system on critical battery level
      (if not installed, the scripts in 'bin' will be used, see below)


Usage:
-------
- Make battmon executable:

    chmod +x ./battmon.py

  and run:

    ./battmon.py

- or just run:

    python ./battmon.py

- To see all available options run Battmon with `-h` or `--help` option.


Notes:
-------
- Currently systemd/upower isn't supported and probably will never be.

- If you have pm-utils installed, then
  remember that, this commands must be execute as a root.
  To do so just edit `/etc/sudoers` file and add something like this, replacing username
  with your own user name:

    your_username ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-hibernate
    your_username ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend
    your_username ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend-hybrid

  or enable it for a group, remember to replace group and <PATH_TO_BATTMON>:

    %your_group ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-hibernate
    %your_group ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend
    %your_group ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend-hybrid

- If you don't have pm-utils installed, scripts in `bin` folder must be executed
  as a root, to allow regular user suspend, hibernate or shutdown computer.
  The easiest way to to do this, is to make this scripts accessible to normal user
  by running sudo without root password.
  To do so just edit `/etc/sudoers` file and add something like this, replacing username
  with your own user name and <PATH_TO_BATTMON> with absolute path to your Battmon folder:

    your_username  ALL = NOPASSWD: <PATH_TO_BATTMON>/bin/suspend.sh
    your_username  ALL = NOPASSWD: <PATH_TO_BATTMON>/bin/hibernate.sh
    your_username  ALL = NOPASSWD: <PATH_TO_BATTMON>/bin/shutdown.sh

  or enable it for a group, remember to replace group and <PATH_TO_BATTMON>:

    %your_group  ALL = NOPASSWD: <PATH_TO_BATTMON>/bin/suspend.sh
    %your_group  ALL = NOPASSWD: <PATH_TO_BATTMON>/bin/hibernate.sh
    %your_group  ALL = NOPASSWD: <PATH_TO_BATTMON>/bin/shutdown.sh

- Sound file is search by default in the same path where battmon was started,
  you can change this by parsing your path to your sound file using `-sp` argument
  without quotes.

- Battmon looks first for pulseaudio, then for sox

- You can specify your favor lock screen command using `-lp` argument in command line,
  if none given, then as default will be used first one found in `SCREEN_LOCK_COMMANDS`
  list variable in `battmon.py` file.
  You can also change default screenlock command editing `DEFAULT_SCREEN_LOCK_COMMAND` variable
  in `battmon.py` file, but this will be overwritten when screen lock command
  was given in command line using `-lp` argument.
